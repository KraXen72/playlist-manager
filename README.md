## Use cases:
### 1. you have your music sorted like this:
```
artist  - single.mp3
        - single2.mp3
        - album1    - song1.mp3
                    - song2.mp3
artist2 - ...
```
This app will make ``artist.m3u`` for each folder, which contains ``single.mp3``, ``single2.mp3``, ``album1/song1.mp3`` and ``album1/song.mp3``, and then ``album1.m3u`` for each subfolder, which contains ``song1.mp3``, ``song1.mp3`` from that album. etc.

### 2. you want to use a song in multiple different playlists, but don't want to have the file x times
in this app, you can create fully custom playlists, adding songs or other playlists/artists/albums at a time. Simply name your playlist, and start adding the good stuff:

You can also really easily add or remove any song to/from these custom playlists, just like this:

### 3. you want to make a playlist which contains multiple artists/albums
If you want to make a playlist out of some whole artists/albums, and don't want to worry about adding any songs, you can use the playlist only mode. Here, when creating a playlist, you will pick from only other playlsits (generated by the app for each artist / album), and when you add/remove a song to/from that folder (of the artist/album), you can hit the special remake/update button, and your playlist will automatically update:

### Actually playing the playlists
On PC, my music player of choice is AIMP, but most music players support either m3u import or playing m3u files directly. for AIMP, you just click on the file:

The best part is, this app uses relative paths in it's playlists, so if you just copy your whole music folder with all the songs and playlists to your phone, loading it your favorite music player will be a breeze. (most android music players support m3u import)

## Installing

**installing through npm**
required: ``nodejs``  
run in command prompt:  
``npm i https://github.com/KraXen72/playlist-manager.git -g`` this will install the app globally 
to launch the program, type ``playlistm`` in terminal or windows search.

**running from source**
required: ``nodejs, git``  
run in command prompt:  
1. ``git clone https://github.com/KraXen72/playlist-manager``
2. ``cd playlist-manager``
3. ``npm i``
4. ``npm run start`` to run the program
  
you can do all this with yarn instead of npm but npm works too

## Other Features:
### General:
- select your main music directory
- [rosebox](https://github.com/KraXen72/rosebox) color theme
- all playlists are in [extended m3u syntax](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/M3U#/Extended_M3U), which provides better compatibility with phone music players
### Settings:
- set what file extenstions are considered music files (default: mp3)
- set a ignore list for folders which you don't want to generate playlists for (for example: archive )
### Search:
- a special symbol mode which searches for all songs with a hard-to-type character in the name (anime songs, etc), and helps you add them to your playlist easily (button next to searchbar on the right.)
### Playlist generation:
- a button to delete all generated (only generated, not user made) playlist for a fresh start or if you made some folder structure changes

## Planned:
- npm package and prebuilt binaries
- option search songs by artist, not title
- more in-app explanations of what button does what
- proper electron window branding, not electron-quick-start
- reordering of songs in playlist
